<img width="1567" height="492" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0453ae2-0fb8-4d7a-bd84-2bd779252b8d" />

This n8n workflow automatically **picks** new topics from a Google Sheet, generates LinkedIn post content (and an accompanying image), publishes the post to LinkedIn, and marks the topic as usedâ€”providing an end-to-end automated content publishing system.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- **Google Sheets Integration:** Reads topics from a Google Sheet for collaborative and easy topic management.
- **Dynamic Topic Selection:** Picks only topics marked as `unused` in your sheet, so no repetition.
- **AI Content Generation:** Uses n8n and AI nodes to draft engaging LinkedIn posts from your topics.
- **Automated Image Creation:** Generates relevant images for each post (optional/modify for your stack).
- **Auto-posts to LinkedIn:** Completely hands-free publishing to your LinkedIn profile or page.
- **Auto-Updates Sheet:** Marks each topic as used after posting to avoid repeats in future runs.

## ðŸ“‹ How It Works

1. Reads topics from a connected Google Sheet where `Status = unused`.
2. Generates LinkedIn post text and image for the fetched topic.
3. Posts to LinkedIn with the text and generated image.
4. Updates the Google Sheet to set the topic status to `used`.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- An [n8n](https://n8n.io/) instance (local, Docker, or cloud)
- Google account (for Google Sheets API)
- LinkedIn account (for API access)
- Google Cloud Platform project with **Google Sheets API** enabled
- n8n credentials for Google Sheets and LinkedIn

### 2. Setup Google Sheets

Create a Google Sheet with columns like:

| Topic                           | Status  |
|----------------------------------|---------|
| Best Free Google Courses ...     | unused  |
| Top AI Courses for Developers    | unused  |

- Share the sheet with your Google API service/account if needed.

### 3. Import the Workflow

- Download or copy the exported workflow JSON from this repo.
- In n8n, go to **Workflows > Import**, and upload the JSON.

### 4. Configure Credentials

- Set up your **Google Sheets credentials** in n8n.
  - See n8n docs: [Google Sheets](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheets/)
- Set up your **LinkedIn credentials** in n8n.
  - See n8n docs: [LinkedIn](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.linkedin/)

### 5. Update Workflow References

**In the "Get row(s) in sheet" node:**
- Select your Google Sheet and the correct sheet/tab
- Ensure the filter is set to `Status = unused`

**In the "Update row in sheet" node:**
- Reference the same sheet, and map the row number from the selected topic
- Set status to `used` to avoid repeat posting

### 6. Test & Run

- Execute the workflow manually or set to run on a schedule.
- Each run will pick, post, and update as designed.

## ðŸ›  How to Use: Step-by-Step Node Explanations

Below is how each node in this automated LinkedIn posting workflow works, and what you should configure for each step:

### 1. Manual Trigger (When clicking 'Execute workflow')
- **Purpose:** Allows you to run the workflow manually or as per your desired trigger.
- **Configure:** No special setup needed; use to start the workflow by click or connect to another trigger (like a schedule or webhook for automation).

### 2. Get topic from Google Sheet
- **Purpose:** Reads your Google Sheet to pick the next available topic, filtering for rows where `Status` is `"unused"`.
- **Configure:**
  - Connect to your Google Sheets account.
  - Document: Set the spreadsheet URL.
  - Sheet: Enter the sheet/tab name (e.g., `topics`).
  - Filter: Set `Status = unused`.
  - This node will pass the selected topic and its row details for further processing.

### 3. Message a model (Perplexity/Chat Model)
- **Purpose:** Generates LinkedIn post text using AI, based on the topic.
- **Configure:**
  - Credential: Connect your Perplexity/AI API.
  - Mode: Run once for each item.
  - Prompt: Sends topic from Google Sheet (e.g., `Write a LinkedIn post about {{$json["Topic"]}}`)
  - Output: Produces the post content in plain text for LinkedIn.

### 4. Format Post Text (Code/Set Node)
- **Purpose:** Refines, extracts, or structures the text generated by the AI model to be suitable for LinkedIn.
- **Configure:**
  - Extracts post content from model output (maps answer to `postText` variable).
  - Optionally add any custom formatting or parsing logic as per your brand needs.

### 5. Message a model (Perplexity Image Prompting)
- **Purpose:** Generates a descriptive image prompt from the post content.
- **Configure:**
  - Credential: Perplexity/AI API for images.
  - Mode: Runs per post.
  - Use the post text to create an image prompt (pass content from previous node).
  - Output: AI-generated prompt text, ready for image generation.

### 6. Prompt for Image (Code/Set Node)
- **Purpose:** Extracts or cleans the image prompt from the AI model output.
- **Configure:**
  - Maps the image prompt value for use in the image creation step.
  - No special configuration usually needed.

### 7. Generate Image Polination (HTTP Request/Image Generation)
- **Purpose:** Calls an AI image generation API (like Pollinations) with the prompt to generate a custom image for the LinkedIn post.
- **Configure:**
  - Set the image API endpoint and required parameters.
  - Pass the generated image prompt from the previous node.
  - Output: Receives an image file or URL.

### 8. Post with Image (Merge/Combine Node)
- **Purpose:** Combines the post text and generated image into one payload for publishing.
- **Configure:**
  - Set mode to "combineAll" asHere is your README.md content, formatted for Markdown and ready to copy-paste:
